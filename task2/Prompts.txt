Explain the assignment requirements in simple terms and clarify what exactly the evaluators are looking for in submissions.

How can this fan-out engine be implemented practically, and what Java libraries are typically required, without writing any code?

Is it necessary to use any frameworks for this problem, or can it be solved using core Java only?

What is Mockito used for, and why is it important in backend system testing?

Where and how should CompletableFuture, ExecutorService, or Virtual Threads be applied correctly in this design to avoid race conditions?

What role does a BlockingQueue play in this assignment, and how does it help with backpressure and memory safety?

How should dynamic throttling and retry logic be implemented in a clean and production-ready way?

What is the practical implementation of concurrency in this system, and how do multiple threads operate independently across sinks?

What exactly is an orchestrator in this system, and how does it coordinate producers, consumers, and sinks?

How should configuration be structured so that sinks, rate limits, and file paths are not hardcoded?

How does this design ensure streaming and guarantee low memory usage even for very large input files?

How can the application be tested with a small heap size like -Xmx512m to prove streaming behavior?

How can ExecutorService be used in a simple and interview-friendly way instead of complex concurrency constructs?

What unit tests should be written for transformers, and what integration tests are expected for the orchestrator?

How can we demonstrate zero data loss and ensure every record is accounted for as success or failure?

How should metrics like throughput, processed records, and per-sink success/failure be collected and reported periodically?
